# URL client should use to find logger
# "/data" would mean to get from same server,
# "https://frugal.naturalinnovation.org/data" will get from main production server
# BUT this doesnt work yet - since there are permissions issues if login ot local server then get from production
# url:  https://frugaliot.naturalinnovation.org/data
url: /data
#TODO add info that server should use when launching logger
#TODO add info that logger uses for its own configuraton
#TODO see https://github.com/mitra42/frugal-iot-server/issues/7 and
#TODO see https://github.com/mitra42/frugal-iot/wiki/Moving-Server,-Broker,-Client,-Logger,-Node-independently-%E2%80%90-how-they-find-each-other
